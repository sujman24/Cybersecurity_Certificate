# Cybersecurity_Certificate
An offline website for my Something Awesome Project COMP6441

Usage
Modules
Each module represents several sections of the big cybersecurity topics. Each topic can be expanded by hovering over the dropdown buttons.

Quiz
The quiz functionality allows the user to test their knowledge. The timer will start when the quiz is engaged and the results will auto submit once time runs out. The passing grade is an 80%.

Certificate
A user will have the option to download a customized certificate upon completion of the quiz as proof.

File Structure
Here is the structure of the project directory:

HTML: This folder contains the primary pages, e.g., modules.html, course.html, etc.
Styles: contain CSS files for styling different parts and components of the site.
Scripts: contain JavaScript files governing the dynamic behaviour; dropdowns, quiz, and logout modals.
Photos: This contains all assets, such as images, used throughout the site.
Customization
CSS Customization
The CSS files are located in the Styles directory. There is one CSS file for each of the Pages, ex: modules_styles.css, home_styles.css. You can modify them to adjust colours, font and/or layout.

JavaScript Functions
JavaScript governs dropdown functionality, quiz actions, modals and user authentication. You can modify the Scripts/script.js file to tailor the interactive parts to your liking.
